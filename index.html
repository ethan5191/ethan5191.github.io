            I graduated from <a href="https://southeast.iu.edu/" target="_blank">Indiana University Southeast</a>
            in 2014 with a Bachelor's degree in Informatics. I chose informatics over computer science because at
            the time I thought I would prefer a role as a product owner instead of a developer. Over the years of
            working as a developer though, I have come to realize that I am much more comfortable as a developer
            and enjoy being a developer a lot more than I would ever enjoy being a product owner.

            My college studies had me learning to work with Java, C, C#, PHP, HTML, and CSS. For my capstone project
            I was the developer on a three-person team that created a new website for the New Albany fire department.
            For this project I learned to use Joomla and created an interactive calendar in PHP. We created a
            basic HTML admin suite as well which allowed the admins to make specific changes to the way that the
            calendars rules were enforced. The database for this application was a MySql database run through
            PhpMyadmin. It was in this capstone project that I realized how much I enjoyed the challenges that
            working with code can present.

            I joined the United States Marine Corps working at the TSO in July 2015 as a contractor. A year later I
            had progressed enough to earn a spot as a federal civilian as part of the USMC. I have grown from a
            new developer to a seasoned Java developer who can comfortably lead a development team. I have been
            lucky enough to work with some great people during my time at TSO. My product owner, supervisor, and
            numerous former team members have all made working on MROWS an absolute pleasure. My time at TSO has
            taught me to become more detailed in my coding technique. As a consequence of this, I have encouraged
            my young developers to also try to be as detail oriented as possible.

            The short answer of why I do this is because my wife and daughter depend on me to do it, to provide for
            them. Outside of that I enjoy working with code and solving problems using code. Growing up I always
            wanted to build stuff like my friends who were good with wood working, but I didn't have the skills to
            do so. With code, I am able to 'create' stuff. It's not the same as wood working for instance, but
            it's close enough, and I enjoy it. Plus it's nice being able to work with code and do simple things
            like auto login to an app, or easily track your families finances with just a single click.

            <ul>
                <li>I am the development team lead on the team that supports MROWS, MCPDT, and MCSOR. (Mcsor hasn’t had
                    any actual content changes since 2018, other than a log4j update). I have been the team lead since
                    the fall of 2019.
                </li>
                <li>Our team is made up of 5 developers, 1 scrum master, 2 product owners and 2 help desk individuals
                    for MROWS, and 1 product owner and 1 help desk individual for MCPDT.
                </li>
                <li>We operate in 3-week sprints, typically 15 working days. Our sprints start with a sprint planning,
                    usually have 2 backlog refinements throughout the sprint, and end with a sprint review and
                    retrospective. We are an agile development team, as agile as federal policy allows anyway.
                </li>
                <li>My day-to-day tech stack contains Java 8, Oracle SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Spring 5+, Struts 1
                    and Fortify.</li>
                <li>My day-to-day work has me using IntelliJ, Pl/Sql, Tortoise SVN, Maven, Jenkins, Atlassian JIRA, and

                        <dd>am also the one contacted should any new users require access to MCPDT. New user’s for MCDPT
                            require having there info added into the database via a one time script before they can
                            actually access the app.

                            changes are properly deployed to production. Our organization has its own branch that
                            handles doing deployments, so I am not hands-on in that regard.
                        </dd>
                        <dd>am the one that is on the audit calls whenever we have audit meetings. I also handle any
                            audit requests for queries from the database or screenshots of the code.

                            findings.

                <li>I strive to have no production issues for all the applications my team supports. I take it as a
                    personal failure when one of our applications has to have an emergency release to fix a production
                    issue, regardless of who committed the change. As team lead I expect to catch any issues that my
                    less experienced developers might miss.
                </li>
                <li>All the developers on my team are full stack Java developers. Each of us is expected to work on both
                    front-end and back-end parts of the applications.
                </li>
                <li>We use Jira’s X-Ray for manual testing and use Confluence for our design documents and any other
                    important documents.

                        traveling, how they are traveling, who is paying for it, and how much they are estimated to get
                        paid. Specific orders that are PCS will get sent to MCPDT for their per diem and funding lines.

                        hours instead of weeks. I worked closely with my team lead to design the database structure
                        for the travel claims. We also created the Soap web service call to DTMS, and created two web
                        services in MROWS that allowed DTMS to send us either reject or recon claim information.

                        to create the XML file that was sent to DAI. The team also created a process to receive and
                        parse DAI acknowledgement files so that we could track the status of the orders we had sent to

                        to remove findings across the division. Over the span of about 3 months we worked to remove
                        almost 5000 security findings that existed in MROWS and other applications within the division.

                        now 100% auditable. The Jenkins process does the entire production build process. It merges the
                        release branch into trunk, creates a tag, does the fortify scan, and creates and stages the

                        and services. We also had to remove the old struts html tags and replace them with JSTL tags.

                        responds with all the per diem and travel funding information that specific order requires. As
                        of today MCPDT hosts web services for 4 other applications, with a 5th web service being added
                        this fall.

                    <dd id="eoyDD" class="info_detail">Our team took over the MCPDT code base in June 2022. The fy
                        closeout in September 2022 was the first time that we had to handle the numerous database
                        scripts to set up the 2023 funding lines. MCPDT is a funding application that calculates travel
                        and per diem funding for different types of orders. Since it deals with funding it is paramount
                        that this application works properly. As the team lead, I took on this responsibility to work
                        closely with the product owner to ensure that all the scripts were put together correctly and
                        ran without issue. This lead to a successful start to the 2023 funding year, with MCPDT
                        continuing to create funding lines for all the different services that call it.

                    <dd id="tab1DD" class="info_detail">The April 2023 release saw numerous changes to the data that
                        MCPDT received from MCTFS on its nightly feed. These changes required updating the type files
                        that read the feed files in every night to ensure they could handle the new file layouts. We
                        also had to pick up a new file as well as there was new data being passed the MCPDT needed for
                        future projects.

                    <dd id="sloaDD" class="info_detail">As part of the DAI transition, all applications are required to
                        change from the LOA to the SLOA by October 1, 2024. MCPDT intends to be ahead of the ball on
                        this deadline, as we are working on getting the SLOA fully implemented into our system by
                        October 1, 2023. I worked closely with the product owner to get the proper table structure
                        created. I then updated the business logic to ensure that both the LOA and SLOA are attached
                        to a given order. This way all of our connecting applications can still use the LOA for now,
                        but when they decide to switch to the SLOA we just have to send that info back to them. This
                        also acts as a test as MROWS will have to change to the SLOA as well, but has more projects
                        in front of SLOA.

                        amount on to DAI. I created the WSDL, XSD, and all backing objects needed to allow DTMS to
                        connect to MCPDT and send the necessary data. I have also added in the necessary business logic
                        to ensure that the orders pay amount gets updated and sent to DAI.

    <h1>Marine Resource Order Writing Service (MROWS)</h1>
    <ul class="margin-top-negative-one">
        <li>MROWS is a monolithic web application. It was originally built as a windows application, and in 2007 was
            moved to a web application. It has a Java back-end, JSP front end using a combination of HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, runs on Weblogic servers, and connects to an Oracle SQL database. The web application was built
            on the Struts 1.1 framework. Over the last few years the team has slowly been moving it to Spring, replacing
            the old struts actions with Spring controllers and service classes. As of today, the app is about 95%
            migrated
            over, with just a few pieces left on the old Struts 1 framework.
        </li>
        <li>While MROWS is an old monolithic app, the team has done its best over the years to make it more modern and
            flexible. To this end, we have made numerous parts of the application database driven. Some parts like
            paragraph text, certain rates, and even specific logic flows can be adjusted by the application
            administrators.
            Application administrators are a group of users who have special access and can adjust certain things within
            the app. Other things like enabling/disabling of jobs and user role permissions have to be done via a one
            time database script.
        </li>
        <li>MROWS is an order writing system. Certain users have the ‘order writing’ role. This role allows them the
            ability to create orders for marines. This orders, once authenticated become official documents. They tell
            the marine what type of duty they are doing, when and where they are doing it, who they are reporting to,
            how
            they are getting there, and an estimate of how much they will be paid. Some of the most common duty types
            are
            annual training, schools, and activation. Once an order writer creates and routes an order it is then
            approved
            through different approvals inboxes. The specific inboxes vary based on the specifics of the order. All
            orders
            go through at least the in app authentication routing. This is the final routing before an order becomes an
            official document. MROWS allows orders to be created on a single individual or done in a bulk process. This
            bulk process is used anytime a group of marines are traveling from the same location, to the same
            destination,
            using the same travel type, and performing the same duty.
        </li>
        <li>As a Marine Corps application, the user interface is nothing special. Our stakeholders have always told us,
            ‘it doesn’t matter how it looks, just as long as it does what we need it to do’. In spite of that the team
            has recently began to transition certain parts of the application to a Jquery based UI, using the Jquery
            data
            tables framework. This process has allowed us to simplify the back-end code that builds these views and
            improve
            the look and feel of the application, giving it a more modern look. While not a high priority project from
            the stakeholders, it has gained some decent traction. The initial push to move select inboxes to Jquery has
            been well received by the end user and product owners alike. This has allowed us to put more effort into
            moving more of the application over to Jquery.

    <h1>Marine Corps Per Diem & Travel (MCPDT)</h1>
    <ul class="margin-top-negative-one">
        <li>MCPDT is a small application that is made up almost entirely of SOAP web services that it owns. There are
            two different views that are available in production. These two parts of the app are written on the Struts 1
            framework. The application exists to handle funding for PCS orders sent to it from multiple different
            applications.
            As of today there are 4 different applications that call MCDPT web services to get specific funding
            information.
            We are working on adding another web service for a sister application to be able to send MCPDT order
            information
            so that we can update DAI with this information.
        </li>
        <li>MCPDT’s funding is entirely database driven. At the end of each fiscal year (October – September), we run a
            set of database scripts to create the new funding lines for the new fiscal year.

        <li>There really isn’t anything else to say about MCPDT. It’s a small app that hosts soap web services for other
            applications PCS orders. Those applications send MCPDT the order information, MCPDT does validation to
            ensure
            it’s a proper order that it can fund, then sends back the correct funding information.
